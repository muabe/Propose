#Android Propose

Even though the animation provided by Android is easy to use, <br>
developers are still customizing views.<br>
This is because Android native animation doesn't support touch events.

**Surprisingly, Propose enables touch events to [Property animation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html)<br>
```with couple of lines of code.```<br>You can also implement high quality interactions by combining various animations.<br> Now, you're able to make anything you imagine.**

**_Goodbye to CustomView_**

<br>
#### Propose uses property animations provided by Android.
---
- You can implement interactions with familiar animations.
- It's possible to make interactions without complicated mathematical calculations.
- It's safe as all thread is handled by property animation.

<br>
#### You can add interactions without modifying your source code.
---
- Propose is not dependent unlike CustomView.
- You can add interactions without customizing views.
- You can apply this feature to all sort of views such as Viewgroup, CustomView.
